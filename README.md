# Automated-Security-Alerts-with-Python

Based on current trends and the capabilities of Python in security automation, here are ten common security alerts that are frequently detected and automated using Python. Code automation is critical for managing the high volume and sophistication of cybersecurity attacks and monitoring modern networks. The purpose of the example below is to walk through how a security team might respond to and investigate suspicious network behavior using a Python security alert.

2. **Detection of Known Malicious IPs/Domains**

3. **Anomalous Network Traffic**

4. **Unauthorized File Access**

7. **New and Unexpected Software Installations**

8. **Privilege Escalation Attempts**

9. **Data Exfiltration Indicators**

10. **Anomalous User Behavior**


**Scenario**: Late-Night File Access on Patient Records System at City General Hospital, a large busy hospital in a major metropolitan area. The Security Operations Center team monitors the hospital's IT systems around the clock. Sarah, the new SOC analyst is on the night shift. At 3:15 AM, the automated Python security alert system triggers the following message in the SOC console:
